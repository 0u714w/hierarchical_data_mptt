Build a simple Django server that uses MPTT models from django-mptt to create a Dropbox-esque web interface where you can create "folders" and "files" in an arbitrary structure and then display that structure.

To use, clone this repo and run
```
pipenv install
```

Then run your shell

```
pipenv shell
```

Create a superuser if you desire
```
python3 manage.py createsuperuser
```
